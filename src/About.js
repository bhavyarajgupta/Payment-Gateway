          <h6>
            <br />
            Wildlife is a precious gift from God for this planet. The term
            "fauna" is not only for wild animals but also for all
            non-domesticated life forms including birds, insects, plants, fungi
            and even microscopic organisms. To maintain a healthy ecological
            balance on this land, animals, plants and marine species are as
            important as humans. Every organism on this earth has a unique place
            in the food chain that contributes to the ecosystem in its own way.
            But, unfortunately today, many animals and birds are endangered.
            <br />
            <br />
            Natural habitats of animals and plants are destroyed for land
            development and agriculture by humans. Poaching and hunting of
            animals for fur, jewellery, meat and leather are other important
            factors contributing to the extinction of wildlife. If soon, no
            rigorous measures are taken to save the fauna, it would not be long
            when they find a place on the list of extinct species. And that
            would not be all! The extinction of wild species will certainly have
            a fatal impact on the human race. So, for us as human beings, it
            becomes a great responsibility to save the wildlife, our planet and,
            most importantly, ourselves. Here are some other reasons for deep
            understanding why wildlife plays such an important role in
            maintaining an ecological balance on Earth.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ecosystem is entirely based on the relationships between
            different organisms linked by food webs and food chains. Even if a
            single wild species dies out of the ecosystem, it can disrupt the
            entire food chain and lead to disastrous results. Consider a simple
            example of a bee that is vital for the growth of some crops because
            of their pollen transport roles. If bees are reduced in number, the
            growth of food crops would decrease significantly due to lack of
            pollination.
            <br />
            <br />
            Similarly, if a species becomes larger, it may again have a negative
            effect on the ecological balance. Consider another simple case of
            carnivores that is shrinking every day because of human poaching and
            hunting. The reduction of these carnivores leads to an increase in
            the number of herbivores that depend on forest vegetation for their
            survival. It would not be long, when the number of herbivores in the
            forests would rise to such an extent that they would move to
            farmland and villages for their food needs. Thus, saving wildlife
            plays a big role in controlling the ecological balance, maintaining
            a healthy ecosystem.
            <br />
            <br />
            The human population depends largely on agricultural crops and
            plants for their food needs. Do you know that wildlife plays an
            important role in the growth of these crops? If not, we will
            understand the concept. The fruits and vegetables that we get from
            plants are the result of a process called pollination, a
            reproductive system in plants where the pollen grains of the male
            flower are transferred to the female flower, resulting in the
            production of seeds. Now, for pollination to occur, birds, bees and
            insects, some of the smallest species on this planet, play an
            important role. It is through these insects and birds that pollens
            are transferred between the flowers as they pass from one flower to
            another. Crop growth can be significantly affected if the number of
            birds and insects carried by the pollen decreases in number for any
            reason. You would be surprised to know that 90% of the world's apple
            production depends on the pollination of bees.
